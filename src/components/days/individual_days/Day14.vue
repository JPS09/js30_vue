const team = players;
console.log({ original: players }, { ref: team });

// however what happens when we update that array?
// team[0] = "Teacher";
// oh no - we have edited the original array too!
// now here is the problem!
// console.log({ players });

// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

// one way
// eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars
const team2 = players.slice();

// or create a new array and concat the old one in
// eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars
const team3 = [].concat(players);
// or use the new ES6 Spread

const team5 = Array.from(players);
team5[0] = "Surprise";

// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

// with Objects
const person = {
  name: "Wes Bos",
  age: 80,
};

// and think we make a copy:
// const tryingCopy = person;
// tryingCopy.number = 99;
// console.log({ person });
// how do we take a copy instead?
const newCopy = Object.assign({}, person, { good: true });
console.log({ original: person }, { copy: newCopy });
// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread ( Update: Came with ES6 )

const spreadObject = { ...person };
console.log({ spreaded: spreadObject });

// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
