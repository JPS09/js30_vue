# Javascript30 with VueJS
You can see the deployed version [here](https://js30-vue.web.app/)
## Goal of this project

The main goal of this project was to **gather all exercises** made available by Wes Bos through his [JavaScript30 Days Challenge](https://javascript30.com/) **in a single place.**

By doing that, it would *be easier* to present the expected result to future students.

## Why Vue ?

I wanted to sharpen my JavaScript skill by learning through a Framework, and I chose VueJS since it was beginner friendly.

## Features

- Present to you what front-end Javascript can do for you
